Title: Week 2 – Data Structures and Functions

Topics Learned:

Lists & Tuples: Store sequences of items; mutable vs immutable

Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, useful for mapping data

Sets: Store unique items, remove duplicates easily

Functions: Reusable blocks of code

Lambda Functions: Anonymous, single-line functions

Recursion: Function calling itself; useful for factorial, Fibonacci

List Comprehension: Short way to create lists

Hands-On Tasks Done:

Removed duplicates from a list

Filtered data based on a condition

Wrote function to calculate sum of squares

Used lambda to double numbers

Used recursion for factorial
