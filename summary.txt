Week 1 Summary – Introduction to Python Programming

In Week 1, I learned the basics of Python programming.
I studied variables, data types, operators, input and output functions.
I also learned conditional statements and loops.

I implemented basic Python programs such as a temperature converter
and a simple calculator. I also created a basic data processing script
to calculate the average temperature.

This week helped me understand how to write simple Python programs
for solving real-world problems.
